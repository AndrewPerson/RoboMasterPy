    Used for expressing a constant stream of data.

    To get the next piece of data, call `get`.

    Example:
    ```py
    import asyncio
    from sbhs_robomaster import Feed

    feed = Feed()

    async def send_data():
        for i in range(5):
            feed.feed(i)
            await asyncio.sleep(1)

    async def receive_data():
        while True:
            print(await feed.get())
    
    # Run both coroutines concurrently
    asyncio.run(asyncio.gather(send_data(), receive_data()))

    # Prints:
    # 0
    # 1
    # 2
    # 3
    # 4
    ```

    Feeds can be used to implement push-based data streams. For example, the RoboMaster robot
    sends data over UDP to the computer. This data can be received using the `Feed` class:

    ```py
    import asyncio
    from sbhs_robomaster import connect_to_robomaster, DIRECT_CONNECT_IP, LineColour

    async def main():
        async with await connect_to_robomaster(DIRECT_CONNECT_IP) as robot:
            await robot.set_line_recognition_enabled()
            await robot.set_line_recognition_color(LineColour.Red)

            while True:
                print(await robot.line.get())

    asyncio.run(main())
    ```

    **NOTE:** Data in a feed may arrive faster than it can be consumed. This means that
    you may get delayed results. You probably want to use `.dropping_feed.DroppingFeed` to help
    with this.

    **NOTE:** Data sent to a feed *before* `get` is called won't be returned.
